# 📘  Machine learning and derivatives pricing

This repository contains a set of **mini projects demonstrating the application of neural networks to derivag=tives pricing and hedging**. It is designed with a practical and educational focus, using simulated data.


## 💼 Financial Applications

### 🟦 Pricing American Options

We focus on the **pricing of American options**, which involves **optimal stopping theory**.

We explore:
- The **Snell envelope** framework to model the optimal exercise strategy,
- The **Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm**, which uses **Monte Carlo regression** to estimate continuation values,
- The use of **neural networks** to improve flexibility and generalization in approximating these continuation values.

### 🟨 Hedging European Options

The second project addresses the **hedging of European options**:
- A review of **delta-neutral hedging** strategies,
- Exploration of **mean-quadratic hedging**, minimizing the quadratic error between portfolio value and payoff,
